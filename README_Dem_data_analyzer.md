The last test of this project claims that the right answer for the most frequent job who pays over 50K in India is 'Prof-specialty', even though it doesn't even appear in the whole csv file. Another thing is I think that the question about the country with highest earnings percentage is formulated wrong. I got two of the tests wrong because my code worked including the entire population of the dataset for calculating which country had the most percentage of rich people, but the answer was about the country with most rich people within its own population. I though that was weird, because there are significantly less people of other countries that are not the United States, so their percentages would be much higher, even though they are short of people in comparison. In spite of this, I changed it and got the tests right.
